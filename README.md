Deep Unfolding of Wirtinger Flow type Schemes

#### Abstract

Deep unfolding is a technique that allows to introduce data-driven learning to a large class of classical iterative model-based approaches, creating new hybrid methods. Here, a fixed number of iterations is considered and each iteration is modeled as layer in a neural network. This leads to new network architectures that are still closely linked to the original model-based approaches. However, parameters or even components of the original iterative scheme can now be interpreted as parameters of the network and thus learned using training data. In this project, we apply deep unfolding to Wirtinger Flow type schemes. Wirtinger Flow schemes are used to solve the so-called phase retrieval problem.
