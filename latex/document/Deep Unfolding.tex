Potentially learnable parameters that we worked on\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Single (scalar) step size $\tau$.
  \item Different scalars in different iterations $\tau_k$.
  \item A matrix $\boldsymbol{M}$.
  \item Different scalars combined with a matrix $\boldsymbol{M}$ in the form of $\tau_k \boldsymbol{M}$.
  \item Different scalars combined with a positive semi-definite matrix $\boldsymbol{S}$ in the form of $\tau_k \boldsymbol{S}$.
  \item Different matrices $\boldsymbol{M}_k$ in different iterations.
  \item Different positive semi-definite matrices $\boldsymbol{S}_k$ in different iterations.
  \item Adjoint operator $\boldsymbol{A}_k^*$.  
\end{itemize}

Potentially learnable parameters that others can work on\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Giving weights to the sampling operation by $\left|\phi(\boldsymbol{A}_j\psi)-G_j\right|_X^2 \rightarrow \left|c_j \odot \left(\phi(\boldsymbol{A}_j\psi)-G_j\right)\right|_X^2$
  \item Regularizer's weight $\lambda$.
\end{itemize}
