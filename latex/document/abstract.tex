Physical measurements in settings where light, electrons, and similar existences are involved will result in a phase loss in the
mathematical formulation. The phenomenon is called \emph{Phase Problem} and the methods developed to tackle the said unpleasantness
are called \emph{Phase Retrieval} methods. Due to its presence in a wide spectrum of applications ranging from X-ray crystallography, 
transmission electron microscopy to quantum mechanics, the retrieval methods are highly investigated and coveted. One of the contemporary 
breakthroughs are the \emph{\ac{WF}} variants which are nice and relatively easy algorithms with small memory footprints equipped with nice 
guarantees on the solutions. \ac{WF} variants are derived from minimizing a certain functional and are of iterative nature. Like most 
iterative approaches they are certain parameters that need to be fixed that greatly influence the convergence rate and stability. We aimed 
to optimized these parameters using \emph{Deep Unfolding} which is an emerging technic from the data-driven side of approaches. Deep Unfolding 
is basically unfolding an iterative algorithm finite times and putting it into a neural network to be trained. Anyone who has been exposed 
to machine learning would realize that \emph{Hyperparameter} optimization must be done to close the study which is what we did.
